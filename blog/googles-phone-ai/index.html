                <p>Last week, google showed off a really cool demo phone call. Google&rsquo;s AI called a hair salon to setup an appointment. It went something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-md">AI: Hello, I'd like to make a hair appointment for my client for, umm, the Wednesday the 7th for 12pm.

Salon (Actual person): Ok. Give me oneee second.

AI: mmhhmm

Salon: We don't have anything for 12, we do have a 1:15.

AI: Umm, I'm looking for something between 10-12 actually.

Salon: Depends what she is looking for. What service does she want?

AI: Just a women's haircut for now

Salon: Ok, I think I can get her in at 10am. Thanks.

AI: Ok, thanks! bye.
</code></pre>

<p>The transcript of the conversation doesn&rsquo;t really stand out. It&rsquo;s not too far off from the Google Assistant.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise was how natural the AI sounded.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to tell when you&rsquo;re speaking to a robot versus a human. But, this robot was convincing. Both for the Salon and me as an outside listener.</p>

<p>Having listened a few more times, I think there&rsquo;s two things that set it apart from previous iterations.</p>

<p>First, the AI speaks with imperfection and variation. It doesn&rsquo;t pronounce words identically each time.</p>

<p>Second, it adds filler words, like <em>umm</em> and <em>ahh</em>. It even uses <em>mmhhmm</em> instead of a more defined affirmative response like <em>yes</em>, <em>yep</em>, or <em>sure</em>.</p>

<p>These may seem like trivial things to us. But it seems to make a big difference in our interpretation of what is natural speech and what is not.</p>

<p>Regarding the <em>intelligence</em> of the robot, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a great leap here. Making an appointment is a very well-defined task. There&rsquo;s only so many possibilities for where the conversation can go.</p>

<p>This takes me to the bigger picture. Clearly, robots will start sounding more and more human-like. In 5 years, most of our appointments may be made by robots. Heck, <a href="https://x.ai">x.ai</a> has already been setting up meetings through email for a few years.</p>

<p>But, I still don&rsquo;t see anything here that signals progress towards general intelligence. Like ours. And I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.
I&rsquo;m with Elon Musk, Ray Kurzwell and the other doomsdayers here. Once a machine can reach our level of intelligence, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping it from going beyond it. It will be the end for us.</p>

<p>(If you&rsquo;re interested in going deeper down the AI doomsday rabit-hole, Wait But Why has a great <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">post</a> about it.)</p>

<p>So, it seems that all we have here is a robot that can handle calls that were pretty <em>robotic</em> in the first place. I mean think about it. If the hair salon was online, I&rsquo;d just click a few buttons to set up an appointment. Or if they had an app, I could probably ask google assistant to do it for me already.</p>

<p>If this means robots can handle more of these robotic tasks with less work for me, I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
